# 1. One data set that interests me is SEDAC's (Socioeconomic Data and Applications Center) data on food insecurity hotspots. The data set tracks level and amount of food insecurity from 2009 to 2019 in Central Asia and America, along with most of Africa. The levels are Famine, Emergency, Crisis, Stressed, and Minimal. The URL is (https://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/data/set/food-food-insecurity-hotspots). Some potential applications of the data set are to determine where to send humanitarian workers or aid, see which areas are improving their food security, and track consecutive insecurity events.
# 2. One book that interests me is The Promise and Peril of Big Data by David Bollier of The Aspen Institute. The URL is [https://www.aspeninstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/files/content/docs/pubs/The_Promise_and_Peril_of_Big_Data.pdf](https://ahtn94.github.io/). The book explains what big data is, how health care, business, and society are impacted by big data, and ways that ethical issues can be acknowledged. I am interested in this book because I find the societal consequences from big data fascinating. Laws are slow to catch up to technology and culture, so punishment of companies from unethical practices is often a slap on the wrist.
